I got a issue when update or upgrade 

'http://dl.google.com/linux/earth/deb stable InRelease' doesn't support architecture 'i386'

Therefore I need to solve this problem. long time later I found simillar issuee on Stackoverflow 

https://askubuntu.com/questions/741410/skipping-acquire-of-configured-file-main-binary-i386-packages-as-repository-x

Solver said, have to edit document  in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-chrome.list

MY cause of problem is in google-earth-pro.lit not in google-chrome.list

cat /etc/apt.sources.list.d/google-earth-pro.list
and then add [arch-amd64] between 'deb' 'http://dl.google.com/linux/earth/deb/ stable main'

before : deb' 'http://dl.google.com/linux/chrome/deb/ stable main'

after : deb [arch-amd64] between 'deb' 'http://dl.google.com/linux/earth/deb/ stable main'
